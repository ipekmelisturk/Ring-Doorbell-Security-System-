# Ring-Doorbell-Security-System-
This project utilized Haar Cascade and OpenCV to implement facial recognition with an accuracy of 70% on Raspberry Pi. Since the security was important and 70% was not enough the OpenCV's facial recognition library is used. Developed an Android application for user login, face registration, and viewing a live camera feed. Systems opens the door with a servo motor or sends the intruderâ€™s photo depending on facial recognition.
